# Go For Launch

## Description 

This was the first assignment from the UConn Coding Boot Camp curriculum which combined the first week's topics: Git, Terminal, GitHub, GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS and Web Accessibility.

## Goals

There were two goals to this assignment: 
1) To refractor, or restructure, the initial source code and modify it in order to improve its operation without altering its functionality.
2) To adhere to accessibility standards - ways in which people with disabilities can access.  

The goals can be further understood by the following definitions:

**HTML Accessibility:** *the ease with which a user is able to navigate and interact with your site; this involves making the HTML code as semantic as possible.*

**Semantic HTML:** *have the HTML element correspond to its correct purpose as much as possible.* 

Ex. Instead of using the non-semantic element (such as **div**) for Table#1 you could change the **div** element to the semantic element **table** so that the **table** element is referring to Table#1. 

**Semantic Elements:** *elements with meaning.*

### Instructions
Our instructions were based on a the following User Story:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
Our webpage had to meet the following criteria: 

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Developer
<!--Horiseon, a marketing agency,  Online Service's website experienced a number of HTML semantic challenges in the initial code, which can be found in the initial commit.
These challenges went against accessibility standards.  I focused on making sure the application's links functioned correctly, consolidating 
the CSS selectors to follow semantic structure, and commenting the CSS and HTML files appropriately.
